# Parallel Processing in Python
A gentle introduction to parallel processing in Python - all analogies my own.

Talk first given at Python User Group Singapore, Aug 2019.

Code snippets adapted from my Medium article on [Accelerating Batch Processing of Images](https://medium.com/@ongchinhwee/accelerating-batch-processing-of-images-in-python-with-gsutil-numba-and-concurrent-futures-60ae0a99f68d?source=friends_link&sk=a4ea59db83e70d808ec616ffc2146c6d), cross-posted on [my portfolio page](https://ongchinhwee.me/accelerating-batch-processing/).

Feel free to file a GitHub issue on this repo if you would like to discuss further on parallel processing in Python - I'd love to hear your perspectives (and dig your brains)!
